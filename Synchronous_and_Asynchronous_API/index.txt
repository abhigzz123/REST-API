					Synchronous API and Asynchronous API

* Synchronous -   It is when client hits the endpoint and get the response instantaneously from the server. 
				  ex - We hit the api as "sample_domain/users/1".
				  We got the response as 
				  {
				  	id:1,
				  	name:"Abhigyan Pandey",
				  	location:"Lucknow"
				  }

*Asynchronous - It is when client hits the api , but the desired result will not be 
                returned instantly , instead a new URI might be given in the response , and on hitting that new URI we can get our desired response after the data is fetched. 
                ex- now let's assume that we want to upload a file on a server as "custom_domain/fileupload" and file_name is = "21/1/2022T1:45:00.csv"
                so it will return a response as 
                {
                	filename:"21/1/2022T1:45:00.csv",
                	status: "upload in progress"  (It might be in progress or failed or done)
                }
